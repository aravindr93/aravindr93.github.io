== Short Bio

I am an undergraduate student at IIT Madras, affiliated with the [http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/ RISE] and [http://cmsrv.iitm.ac.in/ilds/home/ ILDS] labs. I work with Prof. [http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/ Balaraman Ravindran] on reinforcement learning and optimization. For my previous work on topological graph search in context of computational sustainability, I received the *best undergraduate thesis* award from IIT Madras. Before shifting focus to AI, I worked in statistical physics with Prof. [http://www.imsc.res.in/~sitabhra/ Sitabhra Sinha.] From Autumn 2016, I'll be a PhD student at University of Washington with Profs. [https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/ Sham Kakade] and [http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~svlevine/ Sergey Levine.]

My research interests are broad and include many areas of EECS and applied math: particularly deep learning, reinforcement learning, optimization, and statistical physics of complex networks. Current research directions are:
- Theory and algorithms for interactive learning (RL, bandits, active etc.)
- Deep reinforcement learning and computer vision for robotics
- Common representation learning for multi-task and transfer learning

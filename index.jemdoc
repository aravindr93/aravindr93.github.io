== Short Bio

I am a PhD student at UW working on machine learning, optimization, and deep RL with [https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/ Sham Kakade,] [http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/ Emo Todorov,] and [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/ Sergey Levine.] I'm also interested in aspects of computer vision, and learning predictive models of dynamical systems -- also called intuitive physics and system ID. Previously, I was a student at IIT Madras with [http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/ Balaraman Ravindran,] and received the best undergraduate thesis award. Before switching focus to AI, I worked in statistical physics of complex networks with [http://www.imsc.res.in/~sitabhra/ Sitabhra Sinha.]

My research interests are broad and include many areas of applied math like: optimization, (deep/machine) learning, optimal control, statistical physics, and dynamical systems. Current research directions are:
- Policy optimization using natural gradients and Newton-CG
- Reconciling policy search with trajectory optimization (specifically, iLQG and DDP)
- Learning intuitive models of physics from video data

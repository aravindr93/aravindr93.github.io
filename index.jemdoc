== Short Bio

I am a second year PhD student at UW working on machine learning with [https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/ Sham Kakade] and [http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/ Emo Todorov.] I also collaborate with [https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/ Sergey Levine] and his students. My current research focus is on stochastic optimization and reinforcement learning. I am also interested in robotics applications (especially hand manipulation) and learning in game-theoretic (partial information) settings.
#For the summer of 2017, I interned at OpenAI with John Schulman and Igor Mordatch. We worked on improving policy gradient methods and applications in dexterous hand manipulation and multi-agent systems.

Previously, I was a student at IIT Madras with [http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/ Balaraman Ravindran,] and received the best undergraduate thesis award. Before switching focus to AI, I worked on statistical physics of complex networks.

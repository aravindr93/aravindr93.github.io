== Short Bio

I am an undergraduate student at IIT Madras, affiliated with the [http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/ RISE] lab and [http://cmsrv.iitm.ac.in/ilds/home/ ILDS] initiative. I have had wonderful experiences working with Profs. [http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/ Ravindran,] Shankar Narasimhan, and Sridharaumar. For my work on topological graph search in context of computational sustainability, I recieved the best undergraduate thesis award from IIT Madras. Previously, I was a summer intern at [https://www.imsc.res.in/ IMSc] CS and statistical physics with [http://www.imsc.res.in/~sitabhra/ Sitabhra Sinha]. From Autumn 2016, I'll be a PhD student at University of Washington with Profs. [https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/ Sham Kakade] and [http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~svlevine/ Sergey Levine.]

My research interests are broad and include optimization, machine learning, network science, and control. Some questions I have been thinking about are:
- Theory and algorithms for interactive learning (RL, bandits, active etc.)
- Deep reinforcement learning and computer vision for robotics
- Common representation learning for multi-task, multi-view, and multi-modal settings

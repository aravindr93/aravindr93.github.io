== Short Bio

I am a PhD student at UW working on deep reinforcement learning with [https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/ Sham Kakade], [http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/ Emo Todorov], and [http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~svlevine/ Sergey Levine.] I'm also interested in aspects of computer vision and learning of predictive models now popular as intuitive physics. Previously, I was a student at IIT Madras with [http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/ Balaraman Ravindran,] and received the best undergraduate thesis award. Before switching focus to AI, I worked in statistical physics with [http://www.imsc.res.in/~sitabhra/ Sitabhra Sinha.]

My research interests are broad and include many areas of EECS and applied math like: deep learning, reinforcement learning, optimization, statistical physics, and dynamical systems. Current research directions are:
- Deep RL and computer vision for robotics
- Multi-task and transfer learning in RL and beyond
- Intuitive physics and learning of predictive models for planning and control
